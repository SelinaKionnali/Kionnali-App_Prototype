## Project Overview

The Kionnali-App-Prototype was developed as an early-stage visual prototype to demonstrate the potential features and interface of the Kionnali Living Systems app. This prototype was used to showcase the envisioned user experience to potential investors, focusing on how the app would enable users to monitor and control their Integrated Energy System (IES) and interact with various system components within LightForm homes.

## Key Features

- **Sign-In Page:** A welcoming entry point with branding and authentication options.
- **Dashboard:** Central hub for viewing system status and updates, with quick access to individual system pages (e.g. Power and Thermal).
- **Command Center:** Allows users to configure different energy modes (e.g., Morning, Night) tailored to their lifestyle and energy usage.
- **System Pages:** Dedicated sections for managing different aspects of the home, such as power management, thermal regulation, and water usage. Each page visualises relevant data and offers control options.
- **Community and Marketplace:** Conceptual pages to showcase how users can engage with the broader Kionnali community, access a marketplace, and manage their personal profile.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React
- **Design:** Custom UI elements and components to align with the Kionnali Living Systems brand.
- **Data Handling:** No real data integration; static content was used for demonstration purposes.

## Purpose and Usage

This prototype was created to:
- Provide a clickable demo for stakeholders, allowing them to explore potential features and interface designs.
- Serve as a foundation for the current V0 project, which is being developed using React Native with plans for live data integration.

## Limitations

- **No Live Data:** The prototype does not connect to any backend or live data sources.
- **Static Content:** Interaction is limited to pre-defined pathways with no dynamic content or data updates.

## Future Directions

The insights from this prototype directly informed the development of the current V0 project. The decision to transition to React Native was made to support cross-platform development, enhance performance, and prepare the app for future live data integration and user interaction features.
